## Feedback in Angular

```
An attempt to learn AngularJS, Firebase, Google Web Starter Kit, ES6, Typescript and Material Design
```
## Reflection

This was done using Angular 1. Now we have Angular 2. Recently I watched
[Brad Green talk](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/angular-2-and-the-future-of-html5-apps)
keynote from the O'Reilly Fluent Conference about how angular team seeing
the future. It is amazing how frontend technologies are moving very
fast. With also React, Flux and Redux in the scene. We need to keep
re-inventing ourselves.

Other code samples while learning other things:
- Twitter timeline (PHP) ([2014](https://github.com/laithshadeed/sample-timeline))
- In-memory filesystem (C++) ([2012](https://github.com/laithshadeed/filesystem))
- Log parser (C++) ([2011](https://github.com/laithshadeed/log-parser))
- Expression tree (Java) ([2010](https://github.com/laithshadeed/expression-tree))
